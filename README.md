The drop_in_files folder contains the ready to go files for different terminals. It is a work in progress.

The alacritty.toml is our brand colors for Alacritty. I don't have the path for it right now.

The OpenMandriva.colorscheme file is ready for use in Konsole. Right-Click on the OpenMandriva.colorscheme and Click Save Link As. Download it and just place it in your ~/.local/share/konsole/ and it will show as a choice in the Konsole color theme window.
